cprops sample code
------------------

To compile the examples in this directory,

  $ make

If dynamic linking is enabled (the default on linux) and you haven't done 
'make install' in the root directory, you'll probably get a message complaining
about not being able to find libcprops.so when you try to run the test 
programs. To let the dynamic linker know where to find libcprops.so you'll 
need to do something like

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../.libs
