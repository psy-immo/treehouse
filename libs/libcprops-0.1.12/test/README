=================================================
cert.pem, key.pem, cacert.pem - test certificates 
=================================================

 o  in the main build directory, compile the testhttpsrv program with

      $ make test
 
 o  run the test program:

      $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./testhttpsrv -s -c test/cert.pem -k test/key.pem

    on some systems you might need to add the path to the openssl libraries
    to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.
    
 o  load the cacert.pem certificate in the client (eg browser)
 
 o  test by connecting to https://localhost:5000. to use a different port
    invoke testhttpsrv with -p [port]
