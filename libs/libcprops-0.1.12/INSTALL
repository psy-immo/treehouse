==============================================================================

If you are installing on win32, see INSTALL.WIN32.

Depending on the configuration options you choose, the installation process 
described here should result with

(1) either libcprops.so or libcprops.a or both installed under the ``library''
    directory - /usr/local/lib by default
(2) include files installed under the ``include'' directory - 
    /usr/local/include by default
(3) man pages installed under the ``man'' directory - /usr/local/man by default
(4) unless disabled, cpsvc installed under the ``binaries'' directory - 
    /usr/local/bin by default. You might want to change this to /opt/cprops or
	something.
(5) unless disabled, cpsp installed under the ``binaries'' directory.

For more on cpsvc and cpsp, see the README under ``svc''. 

	
If you checked out the sources from cvs, before running ``configure'', do

      $ aclocal
      $ autoconf

  if autoconf complains about missing AC_PROG_LIBTOOL or other m4 macros, 
  replace the first call with 

      $ aclocal -I .

  This might also help if shared objects build without the .so extension.


The general procedure to build and install is

      $ ./configure [options]
      $ make
      $ make install

  See the next section for a list of options to ``configure''. 

  To test the build, before calling ``make install'' you could 
	
      $ make test
      $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.libs ./testhttpsrv

  and test with your favorite browser, for instance
	
      $ lynx localhost:5000/test

  Note that the testhttpsrv and cpsvc programs listen on port 5000 by default.


options to ``configure''
========================
for a full list of options to the `configure' script, type 

      $ ./configure --help

The main options you might want to change are

 * features:

  --enable-hashtable-multiples   hashtables allow multiple values [disabled]
  --enable-hashlist-multiples    hashlists allow multiple values [disabled]
  --disable-server-cookies       server support for http cookies [enabled]
  --disable-http-sessions        support for http sessions [enabled]
  --enable-ssl                   enable ssl support [enabled]
  --enable-cpsvc                 build cpsvc [yes]
  --enable-cpsp                  build cpsp [yes]
  --enable-cp-dbms               build dbms abstraction layer [enabled]
  --enable-static-dbms           link dbms drivers statically [disabled]
  --enable-cpsvc                 build cpsvc [yes]
  --enable-cpsp                  build cpsp [yes]

 * build: 

  --with-cflags=FLAGS     use FLAGS for CFLAGS. adding some optimization flags
                          like -O2 for instance is recommended.
  --with-libs=LIBS        use LIBS for extra libraries
  --with-ssl=DIR          path to OpenSSL installation [/usr/local/ssl]
  --enable-shared[=PKGS]  build shared libraries [default=yes]
  --enable-static[=PKGS]  build static libraries [default=yes]
  --with-postgres[=DIR]          enable postgres support, assume postgres
                                 installation in DIR [disabled]
  --with-postgres-libs=DIR       use postgres libraries installed in DIR
  --with-postgres-includes=DIR   use postgres header files installed in DIR
  --with-mysql[=DIR]             enable mysql support, assume mysql
                                 installation in DIR [disabled]
  --with-mysql-libs=DIR          use mysql libraries installed in DIR
  --with-mysql-includes=DIR      use mysql header files installed in DIR

 * installation directories:

  --prefix=PREFIX   - target directory for installation [/usr/local]
  --libdir=DIR      - object code libraries [PREFIX/lib]
  --includedir=DIR  - C header files [PREFIX/include]
  --mandir=DIR      - man documentation [PREFIX/man]
  --bindir=DIR      - target directory to install cpsvc and cpsp in. cpsvc is a
                      simple web server supporting SSL, HTTP 1.1 pipelining, 
					  CGI and cpsp, which is a c based SSI, ie a system for 
					  page scripting with c. cpsp pages are compiled the first 
					  time they are requested and this requires a Makefile. The
					  cpsvc executable, cpsp parser and the Makefile for 
					  compiling cpsp pages are installed in the directory 
					  specified here. This option is only relevant if 
					  installing cpsvc and cpsp.

 * note: configuring --with-postgres or --with-mysql implies --enable-cp-dbms.
   by default, cp_dbms drivers are not linked statically since this would 
   require linking the database driver libraries regardless of whether they
   are actually needed for specific programs. In installations where cprops 
   will be used for a specific program with a specific database, it could make
   sense to configure with --enable-static-dbms. By default, this is disabled.
   
 * examples:

   (1) to build the library only, with some optimization flags:

       $ ./configure --disable-cpsvc --disable-cpsp --with-cflags=-O2

   (2) to install cpsvc under /opt/cpsvc:

       $ ./configure --bindir=/opt/cpsvc

   (3) to install the library and executables under /opt/cprops:

       $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/cprops


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from version 0.0.7, the shared object version conforms to libtool's
versioning paradigm, so release version numbers and library version numbers no
longer correspond. On linux, The library version for release 0.1 is 1.3.0.
