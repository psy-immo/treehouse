.SH DESCRIPTION
calling
.B cp_db_connection_set_read_result_set_at_once
with a non-zero
.I mode
value causes subsequent queries returning result sets to retrieve the complete
set of results at the time the query is executed. This would not be recommended
if the size of the results is very large. If set not to retrieve results at 
once, the number of rows retrieved at a time may be controlled with
.BR cp_db_connection_set_fetch_size (3).
