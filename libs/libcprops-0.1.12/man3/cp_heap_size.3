.SH DESCRIPTION
cp_heap_count returns the current heap capacity, which is approximately the 
number of items that may be stored in the heap before the heap is resized, 
including the current content. If this number is much higher than the number of 
items currently stored, cp_heap_contract (3) may be called to decrease the 
heap capacity.
